# Direct Connect Bot/Status Page

A Direct Connect bot client and status page that reports the status of DC hubs and provides improved search over the one provided by the DC protocol.

Why is this written in C? Well.. it started out as something small and then grew bigger and bigger till there was no turning back.

Depends on yxml, pthreads and libbzip2.
